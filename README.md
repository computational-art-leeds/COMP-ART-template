# Template for submitting your COMPUTATIONAL ART class work

1. Edit and test your sketch using this P5.js web editor: <https://editor.p5js.org/>
2. _Make sure you regularly save your work._
3. When you're ready to submit it, copy your code into the [sketch.js](sketch.js) file by **Editing** it, then **Commit + Push** your version here.

You don't need to worry about all the other files here, but you can optionally edit this README if you want to add any introduction, notes or explanations.

Any questions/problems, email <o.thurley@leeds.ac.uk>
