## üåê View Your Project Online

You can easily view your project as a standalone webpage and share it with others!

### Steps to make your project publicly viewable

   - Scroll down to the **"Danger Zone"** section
   - Click **"Change repository visibility"**
   - Select **"Make public"** and confirm

2. **Your project will automatically deploy:**

   - GitHub Pages will automatically deploy your project when you push code
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

3. **Access your live project:**
   - Your project will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]`
   - Share this URL with friends or include it in your portfolio!

**Note:** Your repository must be public for GitHub Pages to work with the free GitHub plan. You can always change this later if you want.
